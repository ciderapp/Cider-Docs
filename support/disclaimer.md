# Disclaimer

#### Support (Releases)

Support is fully provided to all releases made on GitHub. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/ciderapp/cider/issues/new/choose), and we will try and fix the issue ASAP. Upon issues being fixed, you will need to wait until the next release if you wish to experience the fixed version in a stable state.

#### Support (Compiling)

If you experience issues in the compiling process, support is only provided to an extent. If it is not evident that you have CLI knowledge we will not provide support and will advise you to use the release build. If you experience issues with your compiled build, please open an [issue](https://github.com/ciderapp/cider/issues/new/choose). However, if you have modified the code and your modifications are causing issues, we cannot provide support for this.

#### Support (Nightly/Beta Releases)

In Nightly/Beta releases the same applies as with normal releases: Support is fully provided and feel free to open an Issue on GitHub if you have problems. However, with these types of releases, you need to remember that they are non-stable releases and you may encounter issues. These builds of the application do not reflect the complete state of the app in any way.

#### Support (Third Party)

No support is provided outside the releases made on GitHub and posted in the [releases section](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider/releases/tag/releasepage).
