# Compiling on Linux

## Getting Started

Recommended / Required Development Utilities

* [NodeJS 14.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (_Optional, but highly recommended_)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Python 3.8 or greater](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Basic Command Line Knowledge

::alert{type="warning"}
While not required, PNPM is **recommended** for compiling Cider, and you can install it by using:

`npm install -g pnpm`
::

### Cloning the repository

Open a terminal window in the directory you'd like Git to clone to and enter the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider.git
```

**Optionally**, if you'd like to use the **Development** branch of Cider to test upcoming features switch your branch by moving your terminal into the directory and using git to checkout the branch by entering the following commands

```
cd Cider\
git checkout develop
```

::alert{type="note" title="Success"}
If you'd like to update your repository in the future to keep up to date, use the command _(Make sure you're in the directory, you originally cloned in)_

`git pull`
{% endhint %}

### Installing Dependencies

Now for the fun part, by using `pnpm`, `npm` or `yarn` (we'll be using `pnpm` in this case) enter the following command to automatically obtain all required dependencies for installation.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="pnpm" %}
```
pnpm install
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="npm" %}
```
npm install --force
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="yarn" %}
```
yarn install
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This step could take a little while on some machines.

### Compiling Cider

This step takes a little while on the first compilation so bear with it as it does what it needs to do.

Compiling Cider for specific CPU architectures is a smart thing to do and you can do it by adding **switches** to the `dist` argument as displayed.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="pnpm" %}
```
// For x86_64 machines. (Modern PC's)
pnpm dist -l --x64

// For x86 ONLY machines. (Legacy PC's)
pnpm dist -l --ia32
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="npm" %}
```
// For x86_64 machines. (Modern PC's)
npm run dist -l --x64

// For x86 ONLY machines. (Legacy PC's)
npm run dist -l --ia32
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="yarn" %}
```
// For x86_64 machines. (Modern PC's)
yarn dist -l --x64

// For x86 ONLY machines. (Legacy PC's)
yarn dist -l --ia32
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

::alert{type="warning"}
On some low-end machines this process could take up to \~10 minutes.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
This command would build three separate packages of Cider, AppImage, .deb, and .snap packages
::

### Compiling Cider from AUR

If you are on an arch-based Linux distribution and have an AUR helper (`pacman/yay/paru/etc.`), then you are in luck. Cider has 2 PKGBUILD's in the Arch User Repository.

Assuming you already have access to the AUR and have a friendly AUR helper (we will use `yay` for this example) enter the following command to automatically obtain all required dependencies for installation.

::alert{type="tip"}
If you like to live on the bleeding edge, use the `cider-git` package, this will compile directly from the [main](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider/tree/main) branch.
:;

```
yay -S cider
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Running this on Node.js 17 or later will fail. This is due to Node.js 17 no longer writing `openssl_fips` to `config.gypi` so it's not there in Node.js 17's `process.config`. It is suggested to downgrade to `nodejs-lts-gallium` to resolve this issue.

### Installing Cider

Your new Cider installation setup file is ready for you! You can find your setup executable in your cloned folder directory on your system in the subfolder `dist/` and from there you'll see your new Setup files. Choose the installer that best matches your distro.

Congrats! You've successfully compiled your own build of Cider!
