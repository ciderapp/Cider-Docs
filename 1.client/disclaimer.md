# Disclaimer

#### Support (Releases)

Support is fully provided to all releases made on any of our release platforms (Itch, Microsoft Store and Taproom). Please open an [issue](https://github.com/ciderapp/cider-2/issues/new/choose), and we will try and fix the issue ASAP. Upon issues being fixed, you will need to wait until the next release if you wish to experience the fixed version in a stable state.


#### Support (Early-Access Releases)

In early access releases the same applies as with normal releases: Support is fully provided and feel free to open an Issue on GitHub if you have problems. However, with these types of releases, you need to remember that they are non-stable releases and you may encounter issues. These builds of the application do not reflect the complete state of the app in any way.
