# RPC Documentation

All of the endpoints are paths that point to `http://localhost:10769`, we've observed that sometimes using `127.0.0.1` when IPv4 is disabled (don't do that btw) tends to break and not connect. We're not fixing this as it's user error for turning off IPv4, but if you cannot do anything about it, try using `[::1]:10769`.

### **GET** `/active`

This will respond as quickly as possible with an empty `204: No Content` response, it can be used to quickly check that the RPC is still active.

<details>
<summary><b>204</b>: No Content</summary>
```json
// No Response Body...
```
</details>

### **GET** `/currentPlayingSong`

This will respond with an Apple Music API Response for the currently playing song, the following is an example response.

<details>
<summary><b>200</b>: OK</summary>

    -d3rpp

</details>

<details>

```json
{
	"autoplay": false
}
```
</details>

These are the only 2 potential responses to this request, if it is anything else, it's safe to assume something broke.

<summary><b>204</b>: No Content</summary>
```json
// No Response Body...

<details>
<summary><b>204</b>: No Content</summary>
```json
// No Response Body...
```
</details>

### **GET** `/pause`

### **GET** `/seekto/{t}`

**_Where_**

- `t` is the time you'd like to skip to in seconds

Set the playhead to this time in the song, you can use `/currentPlayingSong` to get the time, (using the `durationInMillis` property divided by 1,000 to get the duration in seconds).

This will always return `204` and if the call fails or the song is too long, it will silently fail, it is recommended that you check the song's actual length before running this function.
